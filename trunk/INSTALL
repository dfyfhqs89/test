Instructions to install gmp-ecm:

0) you first need to install the GNU MP (GMP) library.
   GNU MP is available from <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.

   Remark: GNU MP is already installed in most Linux distributions.
   However it is often an old version (3.1.1 for example), moreover
   without processor-specific optimizations. If you care about efficiency,
   be sure to install the latest version of GNU MP (4.1.2 on February 2003),
   and to compile it on your particular processor.

   Moreover for efficiency reasons, gmp-ecm requires some internal GMP
   header files (gmp-mparam.h, gmp-impl.h, longlong.h). So you need
   to copy those internal files in <gmpdir>/include (see below).

1) to create the binary file "ecm5", type:

      $ make GMP=<gmpdir>

   where <gmpdir> is the directory where GMP is installed
   (default is /usr/local/gmp).

2) (optional) to check that "ecm5" works correctly, type:

      $ ./test.pm1 ./ecm5 # this checks P-1
      $ ./test.pp1 ./ecm5 # this checks P+1
      $ ./test.ecm ./ecm5 # this checks ECM

   The P+1 test takes about 30 seconds on a PIII-366 with GMP 4.1.
   The P-1 and ECM tests take much longer.

Note: if you care about efficiency, you might try to compile ecm5 with the
same CFLAGS as GMP (grep CFLAGS <gmp_source_dir>/Makefile).

The README file explains how to efficiently use P-1, P+1 and ECM.

In case of problem, report it to us, with:
- the versions of GMP-ECM and GMP used (first output line), for example:
  
  GMP-ECM 5.0 [powered by GMP 4.1]

- the machine type and operating system (uname -a or config.guess from GMP)
- the detailed input enabling us to reproduce the problem, for example:

  $ echo 328006342451 | ./ecm5 -pp1 107 5 7043

- the output you get.

Then send you report to us:
