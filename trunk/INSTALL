Instructions to install ecm-5.0:

0) you first need to install the GNU MP (GMP) and NTL libraries.
   GNU MP is available from <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   NTL is available from <http://www.shoup.net/ntl/>.

   Remark: GNU MP is already installed in most Linux distributions.
   However it is often an old version (3.1.1 for example), moreover
   without processor-specific optimizations. If you care about efficiency,
   be sure to install the latest version of GNU MP (4.1 currently), and to
   compile it on your particular processor.

1) to create the binary file "ecm5", type:

      $ make GMP=<gmpdir> NTL=<ntldir>

   where <gmpdir> and <ntldir> are the directories where GMP and NTL are
   installed respectively (default are /usr/local/gmp and /usr/local/ntl).

2) (optional) to check that "ecm5" works correctly, type:

      $ ./test.pm1 ./ecm5 # this checks Pollard's P-1
      $ ./test.pp1 ./ecm5 # this checks Williams' P+1

   The P+1 test takes about 30 seconds on a PIII-500 with GMP 4.1 and NTL 5.3.
   The P-1 test takes much longer.

Note: if you care about efficiency, you might try to compile ecm5 with the
same CFLAGS as GMP (grep CFLAGS <gmp_source_dir>/Makefile).
