Instructions to install gmp-ecm:

0) you first need to install the GNU MP (GMP) library.
   GNU MP is available from <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.

   Remark: GNU MP is already installed in most Linux distributions.
   However it is often an old version (3.1.1 for example), moreover
   without processor-specific optimizations. If you care about efficiency,
   be sure to install the latest version of GNU MP (4.1.2 on February 2003),
   and to compile it on your particular processor.

   Warning: to compile gmp-ecm, it is better to use the same compiler and
   options than used to compile GMP, otherwise the compilation may
   fail, or you may get poor performance. In the GMP build directory,
   simply type:

   $ egrep '(CC|CFLAGS)' Makefile

   to see which compiler and options were used to build GMP.

1) to create the binary file "ecm5", type:

      $ make GMP=<gmpdir>

   where <gmpdir> is the directory where GMP is installed
   (default is /usr/local/gmp).

   If the default setting does not work, edit the Makefile to change 
   CC and CFLAG to the values used by GMP (grep CC <gmpbuilddir>/Makefile).

2) (optional) to check that "ecm5" works correctly, type:

      $ ./test.pm1 ./ecm5 # this checks P-1
      $ ./test.pp1 ./ecm5 # this checks P+1
      $ ./test.ecm ./ecm5 # this checks ECM

   On a Athlon 2000+ with GMP 4.1.2, the P+1 test takes about 6 seconds,
   the P-1 test about 30 seconds, and the ECM test about 2 minutes.

Note: if you care about efficiency, you might try to compile ecm5 with the
same CFLAGS as GMP (grep CFLAGS <gmp_source_dir>/Makefile).

The README file explains how to efficiently use P-1, P+1 and ECM.

In case of problem, report it to us, with:
- the versions of GMP-ECM and GMP used (first output line), for example:
  
  GMP-ECM 5.0 [powered by GMP 4.1]

- the machine type and operating system (uname -a or config.guess from GMP)
- the detailed input enabling us to reproduce the problem, for example:

  $ echo 328006342451 | ./ecm5 -pp1 107 5 7043

- the output you get.

Then send you report to us:
