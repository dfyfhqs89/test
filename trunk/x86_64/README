mulredc[1..20].asm are size-specific asm code for mulredc.
These are generated by the m4 script mulredc.m4. In order to avoid
dependency of the m4 package, this generation is not done
automatically with the autoconf/automake stuff.

If you need to regenerate them, the syntax is
  m4 -DLENGTH=3 mulredc.m4 > mulredc3.asm
  m4 -DLENGTH=4 mulredc.m4 > mulredc4.asm
etc., up to LENGTH=20.

If you have problems, you should reconfigure with the --disable-asm-redc 
option.

redc.asm is a version of redc separated from the multiplication, since
there are cases where it is needed.

test_mulredc.c, bench.c and the Makefile.dev are for developpement.
