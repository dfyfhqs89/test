What remains to do for the 1st release:

Long term:

- print progress (80 dots in step 1/2) [Jay Berg]
- write a real documentation (which format? texi can generate dvi and
  html,	or LaTeX can also generate dvi, pdf and html)
- document how to use the ecm(), pm1(), pp1() functions from a C program
  (may need changes to give parameters or options)
- add a configure file
- tune stage 2 values of 'd' to optimize toomcook4(d)/(d*phi(d/2))
- implement Brent-Suyama's extension for p+1 (how to do it efficiently?)
- get rid of NTL for polygcd, and allow runtime choice between polyeval/polygcd
- change [j*d, i] in stage2 with gcd(i,d)=1, i=1 mod 6
  to [j*d+1, i] with gcd(i+1,d)=1, i=0 mod 6 ?
  (Avoids i0=0 or 1 i.e. d + d -> 2d, or i0=0, i.e. 0 + d -> d, d + d -> 2d.)
- add -fft option for 2^n+1 (in particular Fermat numbers)
- option -nice ? -kill when user on console?
- optimize memory usage in step 2 (use an unique array for multiplies)
