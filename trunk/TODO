What remains to do for the 1st release:

Long term:

- print progress (80 dots in step 1/2) [Jay Berg]
- write a real documentation (which format? texi can generate dvi and
  html,	or LaTeX can also generate dvi, pdf and html)
- document how to use the ecm(), pm1(), pp1() functions from a C program
  (may need changes to give parameters or options)
- add a configure file
- tune stage 2 values of 'd' to optimize toomcook4(d)/(d*phi(d/2))
- implement Brent-Suyama's extension for p+1 (how to do it efficiently?
  Could "Powers of 2^(k/2) and 3^k", Montgomery dissertation, 5.5, work?)
- get rid of NTL for polygcd, and allow runtime choice between polyeval/polygcd
- change [j*d, i] in stage2 with gcd(i,d)=1, i=1 mod 6
  to [j*d+1, i] with gcd(i+1,d)=1, i=0 mod 6 ?
  (Avoids i0=0 or 1 i.e. d + d -> 2d, or i0=0, i.e. 0 + d -> d, d + d -> 2d.)
- add -fft option for 2^n+1 (in particular Fermat numbers)
- option -nice ? -kill when user on console?
- optimize memory usage in step 2 (use an unique array for multiplies)
- parser for input number in symbolic form, i.e. (2^(2^12)/(7*2^14+1)...)
  (Jay Berg)
- compute probability that a factor of a certain size will be found with
  given paramters (Dickman's function, how to do it for P+/-1 ?)
- partial saves during step 1 (Jay)?
- option -c <count> to generate <count> curves for each number?  (Joe)
- document pb with runs < 1s on Win*
