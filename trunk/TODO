What remains to do for the 1st release:

Long term:

- add a configure file
- tune stage 2 values of 'd' to optimize toomcook4(d)/(d*phi(d/2))
- implement Brent-Suyama's extension for p+1 (how to do it efficiently?)
- get rid of NTL for polygcd, and allow runtime choice between polyeval/polygcd
- change [j*d, i] in stage2 with gcd(i,d)=1, i=1 mod 6
  to [j*d+1, i] with gcd(i+1,d)=1, i=0 mod 6 ?
  (Avoids i0=1 i.e. d + d -> 2d, or i0=0, i.e. 0 + d -> d, d + d -> 2d.)
- instead of putting B1, B2 as 1st, 2nd parameters, add options
	for them: -B1 <value>, -B2 <value>
- add -fft option for 2^n+1 (in particular Fermat numbers)
