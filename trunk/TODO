What remains to do:

- implement ECM stage 1 in ecm.c, and call stage2 from stage2.c.
- add option -save file to save result of stage 1 in a file (Paul Leyland)
- print messages for record factors
- implement Brent-Suyama's extension for p+1
- tune stage 2 values of 'd' to optimize toomcook4(d)/(d*phi(d/2))
- take into account the relative cost of multiplication vs square in lucas_cost
- get rid of NTL
- implement polyeval (possibly by recomputing F from its roots level by
	level, reusing the already allocated temporary space)
- allow a range A-B for stage 2
- allow a rational sigma
- documentation: explain the use of P-1, P+1. Explain the memory usage.
- implement special base-2 division
