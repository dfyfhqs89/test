ToDo's:

1) efficiency/memory
- why restrict the use of mpn_mul_fft to Fermat numbers? We could use it
  for any cofactor of 2^(n*BITS_PER_MP_LIMB)+1, as long as
  mpn_fft_next_size (n, mpn_fft_best_k (n, S1 == S2)) == n.
- use mpres in step 2 (Target: 7.0)
- write a mpn version of add3 and duplicate  
- take relative speed of multiplying/squaring into account in PRAC
  (DN: couldn't get any significant speed increase)
- use/implement a mpn_mul_hi_n routine for use in mpn_REDC
- use mpn_addmul_2, mpn_addmul_4 in the basecase REDC [for machines
  where it exists]
- try McLaughlin's algorithm for Montgomery's modular multiplication
  (http://www.ams.org/mcom/0000-000-00/S0025-5718-03-01543-6/home.html)
- consider Colin Percival's generalized DWT for multiplication modulo
  k*a^n+b, where k*a*b is highly composite. May belong to GMP rather than
  GMP-ECM.
- implement assembly code (redc.asm) for other architectures
- allow composite d2 (Target: perhaps 6.1? Postponed.)
- init mpz_t's with correct amount of memory allocated to avoid reallocs.
  Check for reallocs with GMP's memory interface routines. 
  (Target: 6.1? 7.0? Partly done.)
- try sliding window multipliation for ECM stage 1 (Target: 7.0)
- choose Brent/Suyama polynomial according to B2/k and not B2!
- Adjust estimated memory to take into account -treefile and NTT (Target: 6.1)
  (done but improvement possible)

2) interface
- with -resume, print %time for THIS RUN instead of total run?
	[suggested by SleepHound <sleephound@yahoo.com>]
  Add CPUTIME=... in the save file, to take into account the total cpu time
  spend so far (in seconds). George Woltman agrees for that change. It won't
  hurt prime95/mprime -> will be added for his next version.
- when resuming, print the *initial* x0 for P-1/P+1?
- [from Jakub Pawlewicz <pan@mimuw.edu.pl>] add an option -stage1time t
  to tell the step 1 time, when done by another program. PZ: or better
  have it in resume file? (Target: 6.1. Command line option done)

3) documentation
- add examples for typical use to README 
  (see http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=3922)

4) others
- produce dynamic binary/library with --enable-shared
  [reported by Thomas M.Ott, thmo-13@gmx.de, 25 Oct 2005]

5) bugs
- with 6.0 on Opteron, ecm -sigma 3282338991 3000000 < F16 finds the
  input number (ok with 6.0.1). Idem with ecm -sigma 792327798 3000000 < F17
  (this time with 6.0.1).
