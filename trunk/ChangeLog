Changes between ecm-5.1.1 and ecm-5.1.2

- Added a set of -prp* command line switches which will use an external
    program to perform prp testing of candidate and factors.  When the
	numbers get large, GMP becomes very non-optimal in PRP testing.
	An external program, such as OpenPFGW, can be much faster than
	the GMP.  (New code from Phil Carmody)

Changes between ecm-5.1 and ecm-5.1.1

- Added hex number input into the expression parser.  This was needed 
    due to save files from Prime95 being output in hex.  ecm was not
	resuming these.
- Added some porting code so ecm builds under VC6.  VC6 builds an ecm
    that is is about 1% to 3% faster than the MinGW build (which is
	about 1% to 3% faster than a Cygwin build)

Changes between ecm-5.0 and ecm-5.1:

- quiet mode (-q) now prints on stdout all factors found on the same line:

  f1 f2 ... fk ccc

  where ccc is the remaining composite (contributed by Laurent Fousse).

Changes between ecm-5.0 and ecm-5.0.1:

- fixed bug when B1 or B2min is too large, and an overflow occurs in step 2,
	making the computations incorrect. The new limit for B1 or B2min is
	now around 2^53, and an error occurs when this limit is passed.
- fixed problem with save lines incorrectly written when both sigma and A
	are given with -save.
- fixed efficiency problem with -pm1: for B1 > 1e6, use -redc or -mpz_mod
	by default.
