This is the README file for the ecm library.

To use the library, you need to add the following line in your source file:

#include "ecm.h"

and to link with -lecm.

The public interface is defined in the "ecm.h" file. There is a single
public function:

int ecm_factor (mpz_t f, mpz_t n, double B1, ecm_params p)

where n is the number to factor, f is the factor found (if any),
B1 is the stage 1 bound, and p contains auxiliary parameters (see below).
When p is NULL, default values for those parameters are chosen.

The ecm_factor() function returns :

* a positive value if a factor was found (1 for step 1, 2 for step 2),
* zero when no factor was found,
* a negative value when an error occurred.

Detailed description of parameters:

* p->method is the factorization method (ECM_ECM for ECM, ECM_PM1 for P-1,
	ECM_PP1 for P+1). Default is ECM_ECM.
* p->x (if non zero) is the starting point (ECM, P-1, P+1).
